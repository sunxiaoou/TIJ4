/* Exercise 11.25
 Create a Map<String,ArrayList<Integer>>. Use
 net.mindview.TextFile to open a text file and read it in a word at a time (use "\\W+" as
 the second argument to the TextFile constructor). Count the words as you read them in, and
 for each word in the file, record in the ArrayList<Integer> the word count associated with
 that wordâ€”this is, in effect, the location in the file where that word was found.
